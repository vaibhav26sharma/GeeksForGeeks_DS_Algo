# GeeksForGeeks_DS_Algo :coffee:

- This repository follows the Data Structure of GeeksForGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/). I am committing the implementations that I do as a part of my Data structure practice.

- The aim is to go through each of the data structures and solve some good problems related to each data structure.

- Every solution includes a brief description of the problem at the top of the class and also has the link to the problem.

- All the solutions are coded in JAVA.

- I am following a branch pattern here, where say for eg if the problem is related to Arrays, the changes should be committed to array branch only.

- New branches for different data structures can be created
